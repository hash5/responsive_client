# Hash5 Responsive Client

This is the implementation for the bachelor thesis: Development of a responsive 
webapp for a hashtag based PIM system.

## Hash5
Hash5 is an approach, developed by the DBIS Research Group at the
University of Innsbruck, to use concepts of social media within an information
management system. Different everyday relevant information
should be stored in plaintext without predefined structure and only grouped
and annotated by the user with hashtags and mentions.


The Hash5 Responsive Client was designed and developed to ensure
an easy and unrestricted access to this system. A fexible and modular
architecture was prioritized to allow extensions in the future. In order
to optimize processes for users in everyday usage, the webapp supports
multiple devices through a resposive design and especially focus on usability.
